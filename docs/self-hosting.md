# Self-Hosting

Zane can be fully self-hosted on your own Cloudflare account. The `zane self-host` wizard automates the entire process, but this page explains what it does and what you need beforehand.

## Prerequisites

- **macOS** with [Bun](https://bun.sh) and [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) installed
- **A Cloudflare account** (the [free tier](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/) is sufficient)
- **Zane installed** via the [install script](installation.md)

The wizard will install [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) (the Cloudflare CLI) and prompt you to log in if needed.

## What gets deployed

The wizard deploys two services to your Cloudflare account:

| Service | Platform | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Orbit** | Cloudflare Worker + Durable Object | Passkey auth, JWT issuance, WebSocket relay between devices and Anchor |
| **Web** | Cloudflare Pages | Static Svelte frontend |

It also creates a shared **D1 database** (SQLite) for auth sessions and passkey credentials.

Orbit uses two generated JWT secrets (`ZANE_WEB_JWT_SECRET` and `ZANE_ANCHOR_JWT_SECRET`) that are set as Cloudflare secrets automatically.

## Running the wizard

```bash
zane self-host
```

The wizard walks through 9 steps:

1. Checks for Wrangler and Cloudflare login
2. Creates a D1 database
3. Updates `wrangler.toml` files with the database ID
4. Generates JWT secrets
5. Runs database migrations
6. Deploys the Orbit worker and sets secrets
7. Builds and deploys the web frontend to Pages
8. Sets the `PASSKEY_ORIGIN` secret (your Pages URL)
9. Writes the Anchor `.env` with your Orbit URL for both WebSocket and auth

At the end, it prints your deployment URLs and next steps.

## After deployment

1. Open your Pages URL (printed by the wizard) and create your account
2. Run `zane start` to connect your local Anchor to your self-hosted Orbit

## Updating a self-hosted deployment

After running `zane update` to pull the latest code, redeploy the services:

```bash
cd ~/.zane/services/orbit && bunx wrangler deploy
cd ~/.zane && bun run build && bunx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name zane
```

## Architecture

See [architecture.md](architecture.md) for details on how the components communicate.
